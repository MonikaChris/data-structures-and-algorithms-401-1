# Hashtables

The hashtable class implements a hash table that stores key/value pairs. Create an instance of the hashtable, and
call methods below to get and set values.

## Challenge

Write an algorithm for hashing string keys and storing them in a data structure.

## Approach & Efficiency

This data structure has a time complexity
of O(1) and a space complexity of O(n).

## API

get() - takes a key as input, returns the associated value, or None if the value doesn't exist

set() - takes a key/value pair and stores them

has() - takes a key - returns True if the key is in the data structure, otherwise returns false

keys() - returns a list of all keys in the data structure
