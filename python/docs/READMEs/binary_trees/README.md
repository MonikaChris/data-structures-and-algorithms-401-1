## Binary Tree

### About

The implementation of BinaryTree includes a Node class with left and right properties. BinaryTree includes 3
methods that return a list of node values in the tree, whose order represents three different kinds of depth-first
search: pre-order, in-order, and post-order

### Efficiency
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)


## Binary Search Tree

### About

BinarySearchTree is a subclass of BinaryTree. It supports the following methods:

add - takes a value, adds a node with that value, maintaining sorted order of values
contains - takes a value, returns True if the value is in the tree, otherwise returns False

### Efficiency
Time: O(log n)
Space: O(n)
